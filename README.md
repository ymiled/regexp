# Regular Expression Recognition

This OCaml project is designed to recognize words based on regular expressions and automata. It constructs Glushkov automata from user-input regular expressions and processes input lines to determine if they match the specified regular expression.

## Usage

To run the program, you need to provide a regular expression as the first argument. Optionally, you can specify a file to read input from. By default it will search in the given file fran√ßais.txt
